  "instructions": "<p>You are learning that sometimes words have spelling patterns that help you read them.  You just reviewed two spelling patterns that appear at the beginning of words, un and re.  Now, look at the spelling pattern, -ed, when it comes at the end of words.</p><p>You know how to read words that have an –ed or –d on the end.  In this lesson, you’re going to learn how to use that knowledge to help you figure out big words that have –ed or –d on the end.</p><p>These are some examples of big words that have –ed or -d added to them.  Take a look.</p><p>present &rarr; presented		exaggerate &rarr; exaggerated		prefer &rarr; preferred</p><p>Now, you will do an activity where you will complete sentences in a story by adding -ed  or –d to a root word.  The root word will be shown in parentheses.  Sometimes you have to change the spelling of a root word slightly before adding ed.  In other cases, you simply add –ed or –d.   Use the sample words at the top of the screen to help figure out what you need to do.</p>",
  "examples": "<p>Last week, I (inspect) ____________ the contents of my lunch box.</p><p>If you wrote inspected, you are correct. All you need to do is add ed to the word inspect without changing anything.</p><p>Let’s practice another one.</p><p>I (realize) __________ that I got my sister’s smelly tuna sandwich.</p><p>What did you do this time? The root word, realize, ends in an e, so all you need to do is add a d to make the word, realized.</p><p>Here’s one more before you try the rest on your own. </p><p>It (occur) __________ to me that I would remain hungry until dinner.</p><p>Occur is one of those words where you need to double the last consonant before adding ed. So, if you wrote occurred you are right!</p>",
