To do that, click on 3 or more of the letters in the big word to spell new words.  You can put the letters together in any combination, or you can use the same set of letters in a different order as long as you end up spelling a real word.</p><p>You will get 3 points for every word you make on your own, and 1 point for every word that you make after getting a hint.  See how many words you can write before the end of class.</p>",

Those are just a few of the possibilities. </p><p>Now, take a look at the word below and see how many more words you can make from it.  Remember, you can click on the letters in any order, but all of your words need to have at least 3 letters.  If you get stuck, click on the “hint” button for ideas. </p>"
